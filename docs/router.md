# Router

The router makes it easy to map the current browser URL to an object/function.
It supports regular expression group parameters (routes are written in regular
expressions) and provides some convenience functions.

__Note:__ the Composer.Router object *requires* [History.js](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/)
in order to function properly. It can be *loaded* without it, but History.js
must be present to use it.

## Events

These are the events fired by routers.

### statechange

Triggered when History.js fires *its* 'statechange' event (happens when using
`History.pushState` et al). Arguments passed:

- the URL we routed to
- the `force` parameter (whether or not we're forcing a route load)

### destroy

Triggered when a router object is [destroyed](#destroy-1). No arguments.

### fail

Triggered when there is a problem routing. Arguments passed:

- description: a JS object that contains the `url` of the route that failed, the
`route` that was found (if any), whether or not the `handler_exists` for the
route that was found, and whether or not the `action_exists` for the route that
was found.

### preroute

Triggered right before a route actually happens. This event is unique because it
allows modifying the URL that the route will be triggred with (without changing
the URL in the browser bar). This essentially gives you URL rewriting abilities
(think mod_rewrite in Apache). Arguments passed:

- boxed path: an object in the format `{path: url_path_str}`. If you change the
`path` key in the boxed object, the router will use the path you provided to
route on instead of the on in the URL bar.

### route

Triggered when a route happens in the router. The router itself listens to this
event to determine when to run the route and its matching code. This happens
*before* the matching route (if any) is run. Arguments passed:

- The (string) path being routed on

### route-success

Triggered when a route happens successfully (no errors, found a matching route).
Note that this happens *just before* the found route function is called.
Arguments passed:

- the matching route object

## Composer.Router

The main router class. Extends [Composer.Base](/composer.js/docs/base), giving
it access to all of Base's abilities.

It's important to note that unlike most other Composer objects, the router has
global state (in order to bind to various URL events). As such, __it is advised
to only create one instance of the Composer.Router object at a time__.

### routes :: attribute({})

Holds the route's routing table. Although routes are generally passed to the
[router's constructor](#initialize), we'll document the format here because it
deserves its own section.

Routes are specified in the `{"/url/regex/specifier": ['object', 'function_name']}`
format:

<div class="noeval">
{% highlight js %}
var routes = {
    '/': ['pages', 'home'],
    '/users/([0-9]+)': ['users', 'load'],
    // easy way to do a catch-all
    '.*': ['pages', 'not_found']
};
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Routes follow some basic rules:

- Routes are loaded in the order they are specified in the routing table. This
is important, because it allows you to do what we did above: create a catch-all
route at the *bottom* of the table that runs if no other routes match.
- URL specifications (the object keys) are always enclosed between `^` and `$`,
so the route your specify, by default, must be a full match. A URL specifier of
"/" will only match a URL of "/", *not* match "/mypage" (but "/.\*" *will* match
"/mypage").
- The value of the URL specifier key is an array with exactly two elements: a
top-level object name and a key within that object that points to a function to
run.
- The URL specifiers can use regular expression groups to capture values out of
the routed URL and *will pass the values in order* to the routing function.

So given our above routing table, we might set up our code like so:

<div class="noeval">
{% highlight js %}
var pages = {
    home: function()
    {
        new HomePageController();
    },

    not_found: function()
    {
        new ErrorController({error: 404});
    }
};

var users = {
    load: function(user_id)
    {
        // parameters are always passed as strings
        user_id = parseInt(user_id);
        var user = users_collection.find_by_id(user_id);
        new UserDisplayController({ model: user });
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Note that our top-level objects are usually just that: simple objects. You can
create them as controllers, but it might introduce unneeded complexity. You
really only need to use controllers if a particular object *is displaying
something*, which we're not doing in this case, we're just loading other
objects!

### options :: attribute({...})

<div class="noeval">
{% highlight js %}
options: {
    suppress_initial_route: false,
    enable_cb: function(url) { return true; },
    process_querystring: false,
    base: false
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

`suppress_initial_route` tells the router that when it's created it should *not*
try to route the current URL (it will try to do so by default). So if your
browser is at the URL "/users" the router will try to load the route for
"/users" when it's created unless you set this option to true.

`enable_cb` is a function that will *cancel* the current route if it returns a
value other than true. It is called with the URL being routed on. This lets you
do simple per-URL routing logic within your app depending on its state. 

`process_querystring` tells the router that we want to take the querystring
parameters into account when routing. This makes writing your routes a lot
trickier because you have to account for URL query parameters now, but also
gives you the power to route on them (and capture their values) if that's what
your app requires.

`base` tells the router that when you call [route](#route-1), you want it to
prepend the string `options.base` to the URL when its passed to `pushState`.
Note that if you set a base, it is removed post-URL-change, and will be ignored
by your routing table. So you write your routes as if `base` isn't in the URL.
This is for applications where you absolutely need all resources to fall under a
certain path. While this seems useful, it is mainly for apps that run in a
container such as a Firefox or Node-webkit *app* that needs all `pushState` URLs
to fall under a predetermined folder (ie `/content`) that otherwise would cause
a `SecurityError`. In other words, don't use `base` unless you really need it.
It won't hurt things, but it might make them harder to debug.

### initialize :: function(routes, options)

Router's constructor. `routes` is your [routing table](#routes), and `options`
is an object containing some or all of the allowed [router options](#options).

{% highlight js %}
window.pages = {
    router_docs: function()
    {
        alert('Routed to the Router docs!');
    },

    not_found: function()
    {
        alert('Uh oh');
    }
};
var routes = {
    '/composer.js/docs/router': ['pages', 'router_docs'],
    '/.*': ['pages', 'not_found']
};
var router = new Composer.Router(routes);
router.destroy();
{% endhighlight %}

### destroy :: function()

Destroys the router and any bindings it has (either other objects' bindings to
it or its bindings to the History object).

### get_param :: function(search, key)

Convenience function to get the value of a URL query parameter out of the
*current* URL by its `key`.

`search` is the query string (preusmably you got this from `window.location.search`.

### route: function(url, options)

Route to a URL. This function is provided as an abstraction around setting your
URL directly via pushState. Note that if `base` is set to a string in your
[options](#options), that base is prepended to the URL that's routed. So a base
of "/content" would case `router.route('/users')` to change the URL in the
address bar to "/content/users". *However* you would still write your routing
table as though "/content" didn't exist.

<div class="noeval">
{% highlight js %}
// this
window.location = '/users/69';

// is now
var router = new Composer.Router({});
router.route('/users/69');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

It's advised that when using the router object, you use this function to change
URLs.

`options` can contain the following items:

- `replace_state` - If true, will call `History.replaceState` instead of
`History.pushState` to change the URL.
- `state` - An object that is passed as the `state` parameter to
`History.pushState` or `History.replaceState`.

### find_matching_route :: function(url, routes)

Although this function is mostly used internally, you may also sometimes need to
match a URL against your routing table manually. This lets you do that:

{% highlight js %}
window.users = {
    list: function() {},
    display: function(id) {}
};
var routes = {
    '/users': ['users', 'list'],
    '/users/([0-9]+)': ['users', 'display'],
    '.*': ['pages', 'not_found']
};
var router = new Composer.Router(routes, {suppress_initial_route: true});
alert('Route: '+ JSON.stringify(router.find_matching_route('/users/10', routes)));
{% endhighlight %}

### last_url :: function()

Convenience function that returns the last *successfully* routed URL. Can be
useful for managing various state within your application.

### bind_links :: function(options)

This function makes all links in your app behave as pushState links that change
the browser's URL without actually reloading the page. `bind_links` uses event
delegation to bind an event to the window `document` that listens for clicks on
&lt;a&gt; tags. When it detects a click, it routes the `href` of the element via
`History.pushState`. This lets you write your links in your app as normal links
like you would in a static app, but then use pushState to change pages.

`options` can contain the following items:

- `do_state_change` - A function that takes one argument (the &lt;a&gt; tag
element that was clicked) that if it returns `false`, will cancel the route and
let the browser perform the default action.
- `filter_trailing_slash` - If true, will remove trailing slashes from &lt;a&gt;
tags before routing on their `href` attribute. Note that this doesn't affect the
element itself, just the URL after it's pulled from the element.
- `global_state` - Any object that is used as the `state` value in the pushState
call.
- `selector` - Use a specific selector when binding to links. Note that the
selector can be *anything*, not just links. So "ul.trees li" would bind to any
&lt;li&gt; within a &lt;ul class="trees"&gt; tag.
- `exclude_class` - A classname used to exclude specific links from pushState
navigation. So a value of "nolink" would exclude any &lt;a class="nolink"&gt;
elements from being bound. This option is ignored if the `selector` options is
provided.

`bind_links` has a few criteria it must meet before triggering a
route/`History.pushState`:

- Control/Shift/Alt keys must *not* be pressed, otherwise the browser is allowed
to do its default action (open a new tab, for instance).
- The &lt;a&gt; tag must *not* have a `target="_blank"` attribute, otherwise the
browser default is allowed (new tab/window opened).
- The &lt;a&gt; tag must have an `href` must either be a relative URL, or must
have a host that matches the current host the app is on. In other words, if your
app is hosted on "http://myapp.com" and you click a link in the app to
"http://slizzard.com", `bind_links` will detect this and treat it like a normal
external link (the browser switches pages normally).

These criteria ensure that your users have a smooth experience and can expect
accepted conventions while using your app. I cannot count how many apps
completely break control+click for opening a link in a new tab because they want
to bind every link on the site (and suck at doing so).

Composer's router does it right. If you experience any problems where the router
breaks conventions, please [let us know](https://github.com/lyonbros/composer.js/issues)!
