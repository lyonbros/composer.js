# Examples

You'll want to read the documentation to gain an understanding of how Composer
works. That said, I hate reading docs and much prefer a good selection of
example code.

We'll start off basic and move into more complex territory.

- [A simple model/controller setup](/composer.js/examples/model-controller)  
Shows how to tie a model and controller together using eventing
- [A form in a controller](/composer.js/examples/controller-form)  
Use a controller to monitor form fields and update them into a model
- [Simple TODO app](/composer.js/examples/todo)  
Take what we've learned and build a simple TODO app
- [Using the Router](/composer.js/examples/router)  
Use the router to switch "pages" in your app while maintaining state
- More to come!

<!--
- [Filter collection usage](/composer.js/examples/filtercollection)  
Learn how to use a filter collection and when it's appropriate
-->
